## Project 2 specs: Presentation 14th May 2022

- It needs to handle authentication features (sign up, sign in, log out) :lock:
- It needs to handle at least 2 modules (including the User module, it's just 1 extra one)
- It needs to perform all CRUD operations on a model that is not the User one
- The app should be pushed to a GitHub repo and deployed on Heroku by end of week 1, even if it's unfinished
- Before the presentation, the database should be cleaned up

## Recommendations:

- Use GitHub Projects in order to better organize
- The columns of your kanban board should be: To do, In progress, Done and Whishlist.

## Next step

- create the ironmaker NPX
- move this read.me to new project
- create project board on gitHub

Doubts:
